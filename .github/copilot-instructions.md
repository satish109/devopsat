# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized Git repository. As the project grows, this section will be updated to include:
- Architecture and major components
- Service boundaries and data flows
- Key design decisions and rationale

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. The repository is initialized with Git version control
2. Currently contains minimal structure that will evolve as the project develops

### Project Structure
```

```

## Conventions and Patterns

As the codebase grows, project-specific conventions will be documented here, such as:
- Code organization patterns
- Naming conventions
- Common workflows
- Testing approaches
- CI/CD practices

## Integration Points

External dependencies, APIs, and cross-component communication patterns will be documented in this section as they are introduced.

Note: This is an initial version of the instructions that will be iteratively updated as the project structure and codebase evolve. Future updates will include concrete examples and patterns from the actual implementation.
